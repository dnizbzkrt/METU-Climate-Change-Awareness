# METU-Climate-Change-Awareness


Climate change is one of the world's significant challenges in the twenty-first century. The sustainability of the earth's environment is dependent on students because they are the leaders of tomorrow in environment protection. The primary purpose of this research is to understand the level of climate change awareness, the quality of action among students, and the factors that may have an impact on climate change awareness among students. Also, we aim to spread awareness among students by directing questions about their daily behavior because they may realize what kind of consumer they are while responding to this questionnaire.
